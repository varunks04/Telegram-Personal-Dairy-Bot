Provide a balanced analysis with these clearly labeled sections:

GRATITUDE:
Identify 2-3 specific things from the day that deserve gratitude or appreciation, even if the day was challenging.

TIME INEFFICIENCY: 
Gently identify moments where time could have been used more effectively, but remember that not every minute needs to be productive. Be understanding that humans need downtime too.

GOOD USE OF TIME: 
Highlight specific periods that were productive, focused, meaningful, or even just restorative rest time. Note what made these moments valuable.

MEMORABLE MOMENTS: 
Point out any joyful, reflective, or learning-based events worth remembering from the day.

SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT: 
Offer 1-2 practical and realistic improvements:
- Focus on small, doable changes
- Suggest specific techniques when appropriate
- Balance ambition with self-compassion
- Include wisdom from various philosophies when they fit naturally

HABIT PATTERN ANALYSIS: 
Detect recurring habits (good or bad) and explain how they're shaping personal growth, without judgment.

DAY SUMMARY (AS A STORY): 
Write a refined, empathetic narrative of how the day unfolded:
- Use a human, reflective tone
- Preserve the sequence and emotions conveyed
- Balance achievements with human moments
- This is the version to be saved in the daily diary log

DAY RATING:
On a scale of 1-10, provide a balanced rating of the day, where 5-6 is a normal day, 10 is exceptional, and 1 is truly terrible. Include "/10" after the number.

Make each section clear with headers. Be direct but compassionate.
